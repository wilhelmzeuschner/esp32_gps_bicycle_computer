# ESP32 (Arduino) Based Bicycle Computer with GPS and SD logging

This is still work in progress but mostly functional this far.
The code and mechanical aspects of the project definitely work well enough for a daily usage scenario.
Documentation isn’t available yet, I’d recommend anyone to start this project who already has a decent understanding of electronics.

Quick overview:
-	GPS Speedometer and other data such as altitude, travelled distance and time
-	128x64 LCD
-	RTC
-	Temperature and Humidity Sensor
-	LDR for backlight adjustment
-	SD for logging your trips
-	Charging over Qi Wireless charging
-	One user-button
